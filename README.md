# rovLocator
Problem: There are unmapped water tunnels in Toronto, running down the busy streets of the city. The city of Toronto wants a solution to map all these water tunnels. But as you may know that GPS doesn't work under these tunnels so we have to use an ROV to manually map these tunnels. So here in an idea: We have a blur ROV 2 with has on board IMU, depth and compass sensors. We drive the rover along the tunnel and it records data from the IMU. From on board sensors we can collect all these data : Clock Time,	Gyro X,	Gyro Y,	Gyro Z,	Accel X,	Accel Y	,Accel Z,	Depth (m),	Heading (degrees),	Velocity (km/h)	,	Starting Latitude,	Starting Longitude. Here if you notice we know the starting coordinates but as we tarvel the path we do not have any coordinates but we know our motion and compass data. A sample csv file has been provided with real data that you might expect from the rov's on baord sensors. <br>
Probable solution: now we need to predict the next all the coordinates based on these sensor data which represents movement. The mapped coordinates needs to be accurate so that it could be represented in a map. <br>
Preferences: The majority of the ecosystem runs on python so we are expecting the solution to be based on python. A sample of data logger code has been also provided so that you can get an idea how we receive data from the rover to a peripheral computer via network multiplexing on the ethernet data transmission module on board the rover.
